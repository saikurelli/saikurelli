## Hi, Iâ€™m @saikurelli

I'm a CS Student at the University of Texas at Austin, in my senior year of its Integrated BS/MS in CS program (Graduating May 2025). I enjoy working on difficult problems and especially working with a team on them.

I predominantly code in Java, Python, and SQL but I have experience with a variety of different languages including Scala, C, C++, and HTML/CSS.


ðŸ‘€ 
Iâ€™m interested in ... gaining more experience in Frontend in languages like Swift and React Native but love to work on Backend like experimenting with CockroachDB.

ðŸŒ± 
Iâ€™m currently learning ... Go and SwiftUI

ðŸ¤˜
I'm an active member of Texas ACM, UT's chapter of ACM, and serve as the Co President. I also am a TA for CS 303E. You'll probably see me around the GDC, so feel free to say hi!


ðŸŽ¾
In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis and even racquetball since the courts are closer. :)
